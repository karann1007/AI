**Project Instructions:** \
[Capstone Instructions](https://uhgazure.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/OptumAI/Shared%20Documents/AI%20Training/Gen%20AI%20Capstone%20Instructions/Capstone_2_Learner_Instruction_card_2.0.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=YeeyGp)


\
**Create Jupyter Notebook:** \
Click the vertical ellipsis on the right of the folder name. Hover over "Create" and click "Notebook". Name your code notebook just "code" and Databricks will add the .ipynb file extension. 


\
**Install libraries:** \
Run this command in your code.ipynb notebook to install needed libraries: \
`%run ./.setup/learner_setup`
 
It will install the following packages: \
`httpx, pandas, typing, dotenv, langchain, langchain-community, azure-identity, azure-core, langchain-openai, nltk, sentence-transformers, openai, tiktoken, rank-bm25, chromadb, gensim, deepeval, langgraph, tenacity`

\
**Environment Limitations:** \
The serverless compute you are using for the AI Dojo training does not have access to internet traffic. We have worked around this, and the course labs you've been doing until now have all been created in a way that they run "offline". If you are getting network errors, it is likely because the code you are running is trying to access an external IP address. Look back at how it was configured in the labs, to understand how to run the code offline in your capstone.

\
**Submission:** \
Once you have completed your work, navigate to the `Submit_Capstone_Project` Notebook. Run the cell and follow the instructions to submit your capstone project. You should have a confirmation message once successfully submitted. _Do **not** touch or delete the generated csv file._ It is needed for the submission automation.
